      <description>Emacs is quite the beast. It really isn&amp;rsquo;t an editor so much as a operating system, and a pretty good one. It brings the promise of lisp machines onto every modern operating system and makes it quite easy to build a fantastic experience across systems.
Obviously, one of the more integral functions of such an operating system is email, and here, Emacs is a embarassment of riches. There are many avalible email clients in Emacs.</description>
