      <description>I am a Undergrad Double Majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at CU Boulder. I am doing my thesis work in the Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group in the Department of Computer Science, focusing on the intersection of semantic understanding and Simultanious Localization and Mapping (SLAM). I also work in the Autonomous Vehicle Systems Laboratory in the Department of Aerospace Engineering primarily on the visualization of Basilisk, a high fidelity, high performance astrodynamics simulation framework in Python.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Numerical Solutions to 1D Schrodinger Equation</title>

      <description>Numerical Methods for the Schrodinger Equation Notebook
In this project, we explored numerical solutions to the 1D Schrodinger Equation. The vast majority of the content of this project is in the notebook, so I encourage you to check it out.
One intresting note, is that the approach for the arbitrary potential of the Time Dependent Schrodinger equation scales to higher dimensions very cleaning by just using the higher dimensional Fourier Transform (seperate integral for each direction).</description>

      <title>Sidewalk Following Robot</title>

      <description>This project is a robot which, for extended distances, can follow and map sidewalk networks in a global, UTM coordinate frame while avoiding bikes, pedestrians and small ground vehicles.
Our platform is a Clearpath Jackal, again, utilizing a Nvidia Xavier for perception, 2x Intel Realsense D435 which are frame synced and a Intel NUC for control and planning.
We use Deeplab v3 with a Mobile Net backbone trained on Cityscapes for real time segmentation (25-30fps) running with 16bit floating point mode using TensorRT while doing RGB-D ORB_SLAM2 or DSO depending on the sequence for mapping and pose estimates.</description>

      <title>Getting Started With GNUs</title>

      <description>Emacs is quite the beast. It really isn&amp;rsquo;t an editor so much as a operating system, and a pretty good one. It brings the promise of lisp machines onto every modern operating system and makes it quite easy to build a fantastic experience across systems.
Obviously, one of the more integral functions of such an operating system is email, and here, Emacs is a embarassment of riches. There are many avalible email clients in Emacs.</description>
